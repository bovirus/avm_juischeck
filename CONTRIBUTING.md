# Contributing

JuisCheck is *Open Source* (so that you can inspect the code or create your own
version if you like). However it is not *Open Collaboration*. This repository
offers JuisCheck 'as is' and does not accept pull requests. **Pull requests are
closed automatically.**

## Bug reports

Create a new issue if you wish to report a bug. Please include any error messages
(if applicable) and steps to reproduce (if possible).

## Features requests

Create a new issue if you wish to suggest a new feature. Feature requests will be
considered if they are within the scope of the program as outlined at the top of
the [README](README.md) document.

## User interface translation (localization)

Tranlations are only accepted for user interface languages *supported by FRITZ!OS*.
Unfortunately it is impossible to selectively permit pull requests. Kindly create
a new issue if you wish to contribute a translation.
